<h1>A bit about the internet</h1>

<h2>URL</h2>

URL stands for *Uniform Resource Locator*. It contains serveral different parts, including:

<ul>
<li>the **protocol**: e.g. http, https, ftp</li>
<li>the **host**: e.g. www.facebook.com, www.bbc.co.uk</li>
<li>the **path**: e.g. /news/local, /john.smith.95</li>
</ul>
<h2>DNS</h2>

DNS stands for Domain Name System. You buy a domain name from a registrar (e.g. 123-reg, GoDaddy). They arrange for your server's IP address to be added next to the domain name on a DNS server, so that people can find your site. This process can take a couple of days to spread out over the entire internet, as DNS servers take time to update one another using a 'gossiping' mechanism.

<h3>Server-side vs. Client-side technologies</h3>

<ol>
<li>HTML</li>
<li>CSS</li>

</ol>

<h3>Server-side</h3>

Server-side technologies run on the server. There are many more possibilities here.
